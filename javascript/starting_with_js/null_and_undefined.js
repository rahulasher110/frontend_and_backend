// variable declaration and variable definition

// variable declaration means only define the variable, and we don't assign any value to it.

// variable definition means we define the variable and also we initialize the variable.

var address;
console.log(address); // undefined 

// in js if we declare the variable and we use it , then it don't show the error as well as it didn't store 
// any garbage value .. it will show the value undefined

// undefined means we didn't set the value of the variable yet

address = null; // this means we set the value of the address but we don't know the value of the the address;
console.log(address);
