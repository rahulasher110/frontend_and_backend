1) HTML is used to make the structure of our web-page
   CSS is used to make the page more presentable , or we can add some styling to it.
   JS is basically used to make our web-page more dynamic and add interactivity to our web-pages.

2) JS is used to handle all the events , like when user click on the mouse what we have to perform .
   Ex -> when user click on the like button, the web-page show that the user like the post.
         all that happens in real time , we don't have to refresh the page again and again.

   Ex -> when user click on button, we have to show the pop-up , or dialog something using mouse click event.

   Ex -> we also handle keyboard event , like when user comments on something or play some game using the
         top , left,  right and down key ....


3) JS is first called Mocha -> LiveScript -> JavaScript

4) After JS, Microsoft came with JScript. 
   This caused pain for developers to design pages that work well on both platform IE & Netscapes.
   Then Netscapes decides to standardized this language. Then Netscapes went to ECMA international, to 
   standardized the JS. So everyone who follow JS must follow the standard rule.
   Then ECMAScript first version launched -> ECMAScript 1997

5) With the help of JS we can achieve 
    > website
    > game
    > presentation
    > mobile apps

6) window.alert("Hello") is used to show alert.

7) How to declare a variable in JavaScript?
    
    Declaring a variable with var:
        ● Use the reserved keyword var to declare a variable in JavaScript.
        Syntax:
            var variable_name;
            var variable_name = value;

            E.g.1 var name; //declaring a variable without assigning value.
            Note: default value of the variable that does not have any value is undefined.

            E.g. 2. var name = "John"; //declares and assign a string value
                    name = 10;
                    name = true;
            all these declaration are correct.
            Since JavaScript is a loosely typed language that means it does not require a data
            type to be declared. you can assign any value to a variable. (e.g string,
            integer,float,boolean etc).


    Re-Declaring JavaScript variables:
        You can re-declare a javascript variable using var, which will not be losing its value.
        E.g. The variable val will still have the value 10 after the execution of these statements.
            var val = 10;
            var val;
            console.log(val);//10

    Note: You can't re-declare a variable declared with let or const.

    let and const keywords
        ES6 introduced two new keywords: let and const.
    
    let:
        ● You can't re-declare the variable defined with the let keyword but can update it.
    
        E.g.
            let a = 15;
            let a = 15; // syntax error 'a' has already been declared.
            a = 20; // it is allowed.

    const
        ● Const is used to declare read-only variables, ie, they can’t be reassigned and redeclared.

        For e.g.
            const a = 10;
            console.log(a);

            This will print the value of the constant variable as usual. But what if we tried to reassign a value to it?
            
            const a = 10;
            console.log(a);
            a = 20;

            This will produce the following error:
            a = 20; //^ TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

    The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
        ● Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
        ● Names must begin with a letter.
        ● Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this
        tutorial).
        ● Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
        ● Variable names cannot contain spaces.
        ○ E.g var first Name = “John” (incorrect)
        var firstName = “John” (correct)
        ● Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

    Correct JavaScript Variables:
        var x = 20;
        var _name = "John";
        var value1 = 25;
        var firstName = "John";
    Incorrect JavaScript Variables:
        var 124 = 35;
        var *value = 87;
        var var = 25; //'var' is not allowed as a variable declaration name.

8) Different primitive data types are :-

    >   6 primitive built in data type
        > number
        > string
        > boolean
        > null
        > undefined
        > symbol
